### About
<hr>

*This website was created as part of my course at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=bing-brand&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=BG-Brand-Udemy_la.EN_cc.ROW&utm_term=_._ag_1219358808134939_._ad__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-76210237821084_._li_2484_._pd__._&utm_term=_._pd__._kw_udemy%2B_._&matchtype=e&msclkid=a8cb22e88b6e14c02a4b7d3f06cd0006">Udemy JavaScript Course</a>.*

*I created thiis website for people who timebox themselves for their projects. So the purpose of it, is to keep you motivated and on track, it will help you focus on your projects. With the countdown you will add a little pressure on you to throw some ideas, to brainstorm. It's helping me so I hope it will help others on their next projects*

The site contains the following:

* A form which will allows users to create a custom countdown.
* A submit button where you click it and you can have the countdown on the screen.
* We can store the users countdown information in locl storage, so it will allow users to refresh the page or come back to the page on       another day.  
* A reset buttoon, to reset the countdown.
* Once the countdown is over we get a complete text animation. With the title of the users countdown and the date that it finished.

*The technologies we used to create the website are the follow:*

<a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/"> **HTML 5** </a> : Markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/Email.html"> **CSS 3** </a>: Style the web documents

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">**JavaScript**</a>: used to program the behavior of Web pages.

* For the calendar I got inspired from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp">**w3schools.com**</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date">**Mozilla**</a>.
